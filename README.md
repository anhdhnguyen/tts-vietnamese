# Vietnamese Text-to-Speech (TTS) Utility

A collection of Python scripts to convert Vietnamese text content from various formats into audio files using Microsoft Edge's online TTS services.

## Project Story

I've been supporting a family member whose eyes cannot see things and can only hear. To share information with him, I needed a way to convert whatever text I wanted to send into a format he could consume: audio. I wanted something convenient and free so that I could do it frequently without incurring costs.

I searched the net and was inspired by projects like [VieNeu-TTS](https://github.com/pnnbao97/VieNeu-TTS), but I found they weren't quite simple enough for my needs. So, I decided to create a more straightforward version that requires fewer settings and dependencies. And here we are.

My family member is very happy to receive the audio versions of the text he cannot see, and I hope you and your family or friends might also benefit from it too. This is also my first-ever open-source project (with heavy help from AI), so please go easy on me!

## Features

- Converts plain text, Markdown, and PDF files to speech.
- Uses the high-quality `vi-VN-HoaiMyNeural` (Female) voice by default.
- Simple, script-based approach for easy modification.

## Setup & Installation

This project uses `uv` for package management.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anhdhnguyen/tts-vietnamese.git
    cd tts-vietnamese
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Make sure you have `uv` installed. If not, you can install it with `pip install uv`.
    ```bash
    uv pip sync --python 3.12 simple-tts/pyproject.toml
    ```

## How to Use

The scripts for file conversion require you to **manually edit the file paths** at the top of each script. It is recommended to place your files in the `documents` folder.

### 1. Interactive Text-to-Speech

For quick conversions of short text snippets.

-   **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python simple-tts/main.py
    ```
-   You will be prompted to enter text. The output will be saved as `output.mp3` in the `simple-tts` directory and played automatically.

### 2. Convert a Markdown File to Audio

-   **Prepare your file:** Place your `.md` file in the `documents` folder.
-   **Edit the script:** Open `simple-tts/md_to_audio.py` and change the `SOURCE_FILE` and `OUTPUT_FILE` variables to point to your Markdown file and desired output MP3 file.

    ```python
    # Example configuration in md_to_audio.py
    SOURCE_FILE = r"d:\My Code\tts-vietnamese\documents\my-document.md"
    OUTPUT_FILE = r"d:\My Code\tts-vietnamese\documents\my-document.mp3"
    ```
-   **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python simple-tts/md_to_audio.py
    ```

### 3. Convert a PDF File to Audio

-   **Prepare your file:** Place your `.pdf` file in the `documents` folder.
-   **Edit the script:** Open `simple-tts/pdf_to_audio.py` and change the `PDF_PATH` and `OUTPUT_FILE` variables.

    ```python
    # Example configuration in pdf_to_audio.py
    PDF_PATH = r"d:\My Code\tts-vietnamese\documents\my-report.pdf"
    OUTPUT_PATH = r"d:\My Code\tts-vietnamese\documents\my-report.mp3"
    ```
-   **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python simple-tts/pdf_to_audio.py
    ```

## Future Development

To make this tool even more accessible and easier to use, the next major goal is to develop a simple graphical user interface (UI). This will remove the need to edit scripts manually and make the conversion process much more straightforward for everyday use.
