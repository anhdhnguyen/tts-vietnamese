    # \(          Literal opening parenthesis
    # [A-Za-z\s&-,]+  Character class: Letters (upper/lower), whitespace, &, -, and ,
    # \)+         Literal closing parenthesis (one or more, just in case)

    # Added comma and hyphen to handle slightly more complex phrases if any, but sticking to plan 
    # [A-Za-z\s&] is safer. Let's strictly follow the plan first.
